    Finish a function, ``phrase(person, thing)``:
        - It has ``person`` and ``thing`` as input.
        - First verify whether ``person`` and ``thing`` are strings. If not, return ``False``.
        - If ``person`` and ``thing`` are two strings, return one string with the characters in ``person``, followed by an empty space, and then followed by ``thing``
        - Make sure the first letter in ``person`` is capitalized and all the characters in ``thing`` are lowercase.
