Introduction to the Help Feature

ðŸ’» Pop-up a mixed-up code problem to help you finish the write-code problem
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

:Mixed-up Code Problem: 
    * Movable Blocks:
        - Move the correct blocks from the left box to the right box and put them into the correct order.
    * Static Blocks: 
        - The Static blocks are the blocks that are already in position in the right box. You can not move them.
    * Paired Block Sets: 
        - Sets of correct blocks with incorrect blocks that are unnecessary in a correct solution.
        - These incorrect blocks may contain syntactic or semantic errors.
        - Purple edges are used to pair the correct block and the incorrect block. 
        - The correct code is randomly shown above or below the incorrect block.


ðŸ¤— Feel free to use it to help you solve the write-code practice problems!

    Finish a function, ``phrase(person, thing)``:
        - It has ``person`` and ``thing`` as input.
        - First verify whether ``person`` and ``thing`` are strings. If not, return ``False``.
        - If ``person`` and ``thing`` are two strings, return one string with the characters in ``person``, followed by an empty space, and then followed by ``thing``
        - Make sure the first letter in ``person`` is capitalized and all the characters in ``thing`` are lowercase.
